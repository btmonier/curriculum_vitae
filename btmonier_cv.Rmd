# Research Experience

**Cornell University** | Postdoc | 2018-2023

  * **Advisor** Edward Buckler
  * **Delivered:**
    + Worked with research institutions across African, Caribbean, Latin, and
      North American countries to develop cloud computing infrastructure and 
      breeding pipelines leveraging gene activity predictors for sorghum, 
      cowpea, cassava, rice, and maize.
    + Created R packages to interface TASSEL and practical haplotype graph
      software with the R programming language.
    + Developed methods to efficiently evaluate 1.8 million gene models across 
      26 diverse maize assemblies. This involved assembling the gene 
      space of ca. 400 grass species in the Andropogoneae tribe and aligning it 
      to maize. Using this data, I helped lead a diverse team to 
      develop a series of machine learning models to predict if a gene model 
      was to produce a functional protein by analyzing the structural 
      characteristics of aligned transcripts.
    + Created methods and pipelines for both genome- and transcriptome-wide 
      association studies to evaluate water use efficiency and photosynthetic
      traits in sorghum bioenergy panels.
    + Designed a database that efficiently stores and queries ca. 1 billion 
      genome-wide association study results in maize leveraging graph theory
      and data structures for semantic querying and evaluation. This was used 
      to evaluate the biological relevance of pleiotropy and the effect of 
      variation in upstream open reading frames on protein abundance in maize.
  
**South Dakota State University** | Visiting Scholar | 2017-2018

  * **Advisor** Qin Ma
  * **Delivered:**
    + Created a web server for cloud-based expression data analysis leveraging
      the Shiny framework, Javascript, and commonly used bioinformatic 
      libraries.
    + Developed an R package to generate rapid, information-rich visualizations
      for the interpretation of differential gene expression results from 
      multiple widely-used libraries for RNA-seq analysis.

**South Dakota State University** | Graduate Research Assistant | 2013-2018

  * **Advisors** Heike BÃ¼cking and Jose Gonzalez-Hernandez
  * **Delivered**
    + Examined the variability of microbial community structures across next
      generation lignocellulosic feedstocks in the Upper Midwest regions of the
      United States. This was accomplished by implementing high-throughput
      amplicon sequencing and metagenomics approaches.
    + Conducted RNA-seq analyses to determine the effect of arbuscular
      mycorrhiza on differential expression in prairie cordgrass, switchgrass,
      and _Brachypodium distachyon_ under varying nutrient conditions.
    + Investigated the impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal communities on
      lignocellulosic feedstock biomass production under varying nutrient
      supply conditions. This was conducted through evaluations at both the
      greenhouse and field level.

**South Dakota State University** | Graduate Research Assistant | 2009-2013

  * **Advisor** Jose Gonzalez-Hernandez
  * **Delivered:**
    + Helped establish a germplasm collection of the potential bioenergy crop,
      prairie cordgrass. Samples were collected from across the Midwest region
      of the United States. From this collection, I analyzed cytotypic
      variation through flow cytometry.
    + Created the first bacterial artificial chromosome library and protocols
      for prairie cordgrass.

# Teaching and Outreach
* 2023 | **Taught two in-person classes** as part of the _Thomas Wyatt Turner
  Lecture Series_ to 7 students at Cornell University. These classes covered
  the R programming language and how we can use this for the biological 
  sciences.
* 2022 | **Taught two in-person workshops** as part of the _Feed the Future
  Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement (ILCI) Annual Meeting_ to 22 researchers
  in Senegal. These workshops entailed an overview of cloud computing
  infrastructure developed for the ILCI program along with an intro to the
  R package, `rTASSEL`.
* 2022 | **Taught three virtual workshops** as part of the _Feed the Future
  Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement (ILCI) JupyterHub Workshop_ to 26 
  researchers at centers across Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean 
  Islands. These workshops entailed an overview of cloud computing methods,
  computational notebooks, and an introductory course for data analyses in R.
* 2020 | **Guest lectured one virtual class** as part of a _Computational
  Biology_ class to 25 graduate students at Cornell University. For this class, 
  I gave an overview of topics in machine learning and how the Buckler Lab 
  applies these to current research. This also included running example models 
  to predict transcription factor binding and expression for biologically 
  relevant data.
* 2019 | **Taught one in-person workshop** as part of the _Workshop on Cereal
  Genomics_ to 24 researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories. During this
